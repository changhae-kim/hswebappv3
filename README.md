The codes in this repository can be used to:

(1) Use Henry's Law to relate gas-phase and liquid-phase fractions of small molecules in molten polyethylene.

(2) Combine population balance equations with vapor-liquid equilibrium models to describe reactive separation in polyolefin hydrogenolysis.

The use of the codes is demonstrated in Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ggvZduAwJOflgca3TU-Cqk42bl8ySAgb.
